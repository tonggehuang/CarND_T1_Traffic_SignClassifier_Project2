### Data Overview

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

The dataset provided contains 43 classes of German traffic signs. Shown below. 
![alt text][Data Visualization]

The original dataset info:
* The size of training set is 34799 
* The size of the testing set is 12630
* Image data shape = (32, 32, 3)


#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

The image distribution of the original dataset plot shows that the training dataset is unbalanced.

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because for the traffic sign, the shape should be the main feature rather than colors for identifing the traffic sign. Also, the traffic sign color will be varied from different areas. So, the model should still recognize the traffic signs, even though the color is slightly different in some other areas. Based on Pierre Sermanet and Yann LeCun's paper, I used the opencv BGR2YUV and keep only Y channel for convert images to grayscale. Also, I sharped the image to make the feature more visiable. 

As a last step, I normalized the image data because the it is convenient to find global minimum. And the backpropogation expect the feature with same scale. 

Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling and sharpening.

I decided to generate additional data because the original dataset is unbalanced. The model will get more effects by the class with more samples.

To balance the training dataset, some 'fake' images are generated by rotating, translating, and affining the images for classes which leak of training samples. The jittering result is shown below:

![alt text][jittered_img]

By jittering the image, the dataset is balanced to make the model robust. After balancing the dataset, the train/validation data set is split by 80/20. The testing set will keep same at the beginning. The image distribution for balanced training and validation set are shown below. 

* The size of training set is 69144
* The size of the validation set is 17286
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32,32,1)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.
I increased the filter size for convolution layer to capture more specific features. Since the 
My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x1 grayscale image   				 	|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 28x28x10 	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 ksize, 2x2 stride, outputs 14x14x10 		|
| Convolution 5x5	    | 1x1 stride, valid padding, outputs 10x10x20   |
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 ksize, 2x2 stride, outputs 5x5x20 		|
| Fully connected1		| input 500 output 200        					|
| Fully connected2		| input 200 output 120        					|
| Fully connected3		| input 120 output 43        					|
| Softmax				|         									    |

 


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used:

* Optimizer: Adam optimizer

* batch size = 256 

* learning rate = 0.001 

* epochs = 500

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

First time i used the LeNet architecture from LeNet lab solution and keep all the architecture related parameters default. Then I tried increase the number of convolutional filter to capture more specific features. After increasing the depth of the first convolutional layer, the validation accuracy slightly improved.

My final model results were:
* training set accuracy of 97.7%
* validation set accuracy of 95.5%
* test set accuracy of 91.0%


### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are six German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][test_web_img]

The third image might be difficult to classify because white space around the ROI. 

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| 60_speed_limit      	| Speed limit (60km/h)   						| 
| row_at_intersection   | Right-of-way at the next intersection 		|
| stop_sign			    | Keep right								    |
| workzone	      		| Road work					 				    |
| workzone2			    | Road work      					  		    |
| yield			        | Yield     					  		        |

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

The code for making predictions on my final model is located in the 593th cell of the Ipython notebook.
